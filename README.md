# Python Programming Practice

Welcome to my Python programming practice repository.

This repository documents my learning journey in Python and includes practice problems, solutions, and notes that cover fundamental to intermediate concepts. The purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of Python programming through consistent hands-on practice.

## Topics Covered
The repository currently focuses on the following areas:

- **Python Basics:** Syntax, variables, data types, and input/output operations  
- **Control Flow:** Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- **Loops:** `for` and `while` loops  
- **Functions:** Defining, calling, and debugging functions  
- **Data Structures:** Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries  
- **Modules:** Usage of built-in modules such as `math` and `os`  
- **Basic Problem Solving:** Applying logic to solve simple programming challenges

## Repository Structure
- Each file contains clearly written Python programs.
- Code is organized by topic for easy navigation.
- Example outputs or comments are included where helpful.
