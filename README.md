# Python Programming Practice

## Overview
This repository documents my hands-on practice and learning in **Python programming**.  
It contains well-structured examples, practice problems, and solutions covering foundational and intermediate Python concepts. The primary goal is to build strong problem-solving skills and a solid understanding of Python fundamentals.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Python fundamentals and syntax  
- Control flow and decision-making logic  
- Iterative programming using loops  
- Function design and reuse  
- Core data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)  
- File system interaction using built-in modules (`os`, `math`)  
- Logical thinking and basic algorithmic problem solving  

## Topics Covered
- **Basics:** Variables, data types, input/output  
- **Control Flow:** `if`, `elif`, `else`  
- **Loops:** `for`, `while`  
- **Functions:** Definition, parameters, return values  
- **Data Structures:** Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets  
- **Modules:** Standard Python libraries  
- **Practice Problems:** Applied problem-solving exercises  

## Repository Structure
- Organized by topic for clarity and scalability  
- Clean, readable code following best practices  
- Comments added where required for understanding
