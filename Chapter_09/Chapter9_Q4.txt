the ##### is often misunderstood, and many people unfairly call the ##### a #####, even though the ##### is intelligent and careful. in some stories, a ##### hears a ##### and refuses to share that ##### because the ##### knows #####s can cause trouble. people sometimes say ##### things, but calling a ##### ##### or ##### is not kind. long ago, a ##### helped farmers while others spread a ##### rumor about the ##### being lazy, which was a ##### lie. every ##### worked hard despite the ##### comments, proving that the ##### was stronger and wiser than the ##### labels given to it. in the end, the ##### ignored every #####, every ##### remark, and every #####, and continued to live with patience and dignity.
