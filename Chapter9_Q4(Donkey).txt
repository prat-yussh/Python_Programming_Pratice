The donkey is often misunderstood, and many people unfairly call the donkey a badword, even though the donkey is intelligent and careful. In some stories, a donkey hears a secret and refuses to share that secret because the donkey knows secrets can cause trouble. People sometimes say rude things, but calling a donkey rude or badword is not kind. Long ago, a donkey helped farmers while others spread a secret rumor about the donkey being lazy, which was a badword lie. Every donkey worked hard despite the rude comments, proving that the donkey was stronger and wiser than the badword labels given to it. In the end, the donkey ignored every secret, every rude remark, and every badword, and continued to live with patience and dignity.
