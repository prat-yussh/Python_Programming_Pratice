the donkey is often misunderstood, and many people unfairly call the donkey a #####, even though the donkey is intelligent and careful. in some stories, a donkey hears a ##### and refuses to share that ##### because the donkey knows #####s can cause trouble. people sometimes say ##### things, but calling a donkey ##### or ##### is not kind. long ago, a donkey helped farmers while others spread a ##### rumor about the donkey being lazy, which was a ##### lie. every donkey worked hard despite the ##### comments, proving that the donkey was stronger and wiser than the ##### labels given to it. in the end, the donkey ignored every #####, every ##### remark, and every #####, and continued to live with patience and dignity.
